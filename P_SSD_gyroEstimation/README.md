# Photometric SSD Gyro Estimation Dual Fisheye

Estimates the orientation between a given reference image (`iRef`) and a current image, using **dual fisheye images**.

Relies on the **photometric cost** minimization between the reference and a current image whose pixels intensities are mapped to a subdivided icosahedron.

## Build

Be sure to install 3rd party libraries listed [here](../Readme.md)

Run the following commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j12
```

## Parameters

- `xmlFic` the dual fisheye camera calibration xml file
- `subDiv` the number of subdivision levels for the spherical image sampling
- `imDir` the directory containing the **dual fisheye** images to process
- `iRef` the reference image index (in the lexicographical order)
- `i0` the first image index of the sequence to process
- `i360` the last image index
- `iStep` the image sequence looping step
- `Mask` the image file of the mask (white pixels are to be considered whereas black pixels are not)
- `nbTries` the number of tested initial guesses for the optimization (the one leading to the lower cost is kept)
- `estimationType` selects which estimation type to consider between 0 pure gyro, 1 incremental gyro, 2 incremental gyro with key images
- `stabilization` if 1, outputs the rotation compensated dualfisheye image
